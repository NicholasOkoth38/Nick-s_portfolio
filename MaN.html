				<h3>More on Web Designing</h3>
				<p>I got more experience in Web development After joining Moringa,I was only able to create a website using wordpress and that was never fun since it never seemed original to me.
					Here is a link to one of my first web creation after joining Moringa <a href="https://github.com/NicholasOkoth38/My-favorite-band">here</a> </p>

			<div class="nicholas-content">
				<h3>Why not a Journalist or another career path?</h3>
				<p>My mom always told me to do what is felt right and what genuinely makes me happy.In the field of Journalism I could have archived but too much competition out here and I am not ready for that.Becoming a programmer was my dream since I was young and this always came to my mind beacuase I started using computer when I was ten years and I grew getting used to it.</p>
